# Military Logistics Planning: Genetic Algorithm Approach

## Project Overview

This project develops an optimized fuel replenishment strategy for a fleet of continuously patrolling vehicles using genetic algorithms. The goal is to minimize operational costs and vehicle downtime over a 15-day period.

## Key Features

- Genetic algorithm optimization for refueling strategies
- Dynamic dispatch and gather strategies
- Adaptive refuel and emergency thresholds
- Cost comparison between optimized and baseline strategies
- K-means clustering for spatial analysis

## Methodology

1. Population initialization
2. Fitness evaluation
3. Parent selection
4. Crossover and mutation
5. Elitism
6. Solution optimization

## Results

- Significant cost reduction compared to baseline strategy
- Improved operational efficiency
- Enhanced vehicle management and resource allocation

## Future Scope

- Real-time data processing integration
- Environmental factor consideration
- Multi-modal transportation expansion
- API development for broader application

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
